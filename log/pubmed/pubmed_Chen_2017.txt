AB  - In experimental research a scientific conclusion is always drawn from the
      statistical testing of hypothesis, in which an acceptable cutoff of probability, 
      such as 0.05 or 0.01, is used for decision-making. However, the probability of
      committing false statistical inferences would considerably increase when more
      than one hypothesis is simultaneously tested (namely the multiple comparisons),
      which therefore requires proper adjustment. Although the adjustment for multiple 
      comparisons is proposed to be mandatory in some journals, it still remains
      difficult to select a proper method suitable for the various experimental
      properties and study purposes, especially for researchers without good background
      in statistics. In the present paper, we provide a brief review on mathematical
      framework, general concepts and common methods of adjustment for multiple
      comparisons, which is expected to facilitate the understanding and selection of
      adjustment methods.
