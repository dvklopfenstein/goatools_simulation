TI  - When to use the Bonferroni correction.
PG  - 502-8
LID - 10.1111/opo.12131 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The Bonferroni correction adjusts probability (p) values because of the 
      increased risk of a type I error when making multiple statistical tests. The
      routine use of this test has been criticised as deleterious to sound statistical 
      judgment, testing the wrong hypothesis, and reducing the chance of a type I error
      but at the expense of a type II error; yet it remains popular in ophthalmic
      research. The purpose of this article was to survey the use of the Bonferroni
      correction in research articles published in three optometric journals, viz.
      Ophthalmic & Physiological Optics, Optometry & Vision Science, and Clinical &
      Experimental Optometry, and to provide advice to authors contemplating multiple
      testing. RECENT FINDINGS: Some authors ignored the problem of multiple testing
      while others used the method uncritically with no rationale or discussion. A
      variety of methods of correcting p values were employed, the Bonferroni method
      being the single most popular. Bonferroni was used in a variety of circumstances,
      most commonly to correct the experiment-wise error rate when using multiple 't'
      tests or as a post-hoc procedure to correct the family-wise error rate following 
      analysis of variance (anova). Some studies quoted adjusted p values incorrectly
      or gave an erroneous rationale. SUMMARY: Whether or not to use the Bonferroni
      correction depends on the circumstances of the study. It should not be used
      routinely and should be considered if: (1) a single test of the 'universal null
      hypothesis' (Ho ) that all tests are not significant is required, (2) it is
      imperative to avoid a type I error, and (3) a large number of tests are carried
      out without preplanned hypotheses.
