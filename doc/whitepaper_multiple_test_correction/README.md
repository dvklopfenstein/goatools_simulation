Individual Authors

If you're an individual author, it works best to simply upload your paper to your website, e.g., www.example.edu/~professor/jpdr2009.pdf; and add a link to it on your publications page, such as www.example.edu/~professor/publications.html. Make sure that:

* the full text of your paper is in a PDF file that ends with ".pdf",
* the title of the paper appears in a large font on top of the first page,
* the authors of the paper are listed right below the title on a separate line, and
* there's a bibliography section titled, e.g., "References" or "Bibliography" at the end.
